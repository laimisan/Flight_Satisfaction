# Flight_Satisfaction
Passenger flight satisfaction data analysis using Python.

Data taken from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/teejmahal20/airline-passenger-satisfaction

In this project I:

- explore an American airline company's data regarding their passenger satisfaction,
- build and compare the performance of two machine learning models for predicting passenger satisfaction (Neural Network and Random Forest Classifier),
- investigate the relationship between overall satisfaction and various flight aspects,
- make recommendations to the airline regarding which aspects to focus on in order to increase passenger satisfaction.
